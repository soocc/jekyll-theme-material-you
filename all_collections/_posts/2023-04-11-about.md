### Hi, my name’s Samuel! I’m an aspiring `website developer`.

My interest for web development started in 2023 when I decided to try to create a website for myself using Google Sites - _in fact, that website is still [here](https://www.soocc.dev) if you want to check it out!_ However, Google Sites did not have enough features to satisfy my desired design, so I turned to other website creators at the time. That is when I found github pages, and from then on I began passionately programming my own website.
